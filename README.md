## Welcome! This is my GitHub Tutorial

1. Create a GitHub account for free [here](https://github.com/join)
---
2. Create an introductory repository named "userName.github.io". This allows you to build a website from the created repository. You can visit the website at www.userName.github.io
---
3. Go to the repository's settings, and under the "Code and Automation" tab choose a theme.
---
4. The mark down file should open up, in which you can edit the contents of the website. 
---
5. Be sure to commit your changes.


The website made with this markdown is [here](https://red-peel.github.io/)
